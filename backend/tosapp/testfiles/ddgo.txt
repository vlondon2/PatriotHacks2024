DuckDuckGo Terms of Service
DuckDuckGo (officially, Duck Duck Go, Inc.) has been an independent company since its founding in 2008.

We offer an all-in-one privacy product to help protect your everyday online activities. While we started as a search engine, our apps and extensions now offer protection well beyond search, including when browsing websites, reading email, and even using other apps.

These Terms of Service describe the terms and conditions (“Terms”) that apply to all of the services DuckDuckGo and its subsidiaries offer, including but not limited to our search engine, apps, and browser extensions, as well as all of their associated features (“Services”). By using our Services, you agree to these Terms.

We are not responsible for content that comes from or is created by third parties.
Many of our Services give you access to content that belongs to other people or organizations, for example, search results listing restaurants near you. We have no control over the content on third-party websites, and we cannot guarantee that the content you access through our Services is accurate or complete or that the sites you visit are unharmful.

Some of the content available through our Services comes in the form of Instant Answers, which you can read more about on our Sources page. We make no representations or warranties about the accuracy or completeness of the content in our Instant Answers, as it is also derived from third-party sources.

We do not provide a warranty for our Services.
To comply with the law, this section (and the following one) has to be written in more legalese with specific phrases and capitalization. Sorry about that — we're not trying to yell at you.

You expressly agree that the use of our Services is at your sole risk. Our Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available,” “with all faults” basis and with no assurances that our Services will meet your requirements; that the Services or information made available through the Services will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free, or that defects, if any, will be corrected; or that the Services will withstand attempts to evade security mechanisms or that there will be no cracks, bugs, disablements or other circumvention.
